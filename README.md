Build fast, hypermedia-driven web apps with Dart + htmx

---

Htmdart is a small ecosystem of packages (or toolkit if we want to sound fancy) that makes it easy to build **hypermedia-driven applications in Dart**.  

It offers tools that let you:

- Write and render **HTML directly in Dart** (no template engines needed)  
- Use **htmx & hyperscript attributes** as native Dart functions (callable classes)
- Generate **static HTML sites** with Dart
