Build fast, hypermedia-driven web apps with Dart + htmx

---

Htmdart is a small ecosystem of packages (or tool-kit if we want to sound fancy) that make it easy to build **hypermedia-driven applications in Dart**.  

It offers tools that let you:  

- Write and render **HTML directly in Dart** (no template engines needed)  
- Use **htmx & hyperscript attributes** as native Dart functions  
- Build apps with a **radix-tree router** (groups, middlewares, static files, redirects and more)  
- Serve with **hot reload & helpful defaults**  
- Generate **static HTML sites** with Dart
